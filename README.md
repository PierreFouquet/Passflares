# Passflares

A modern and secure password manager which runs on Cloudflare Workers, D1, and R2.

## Features

---------

* **Client-Side Encryption:** All sensitive vault data is encrypted in your browser using AES-GCM before being sent to Cloudflare R2. Your Master Password never leaves your device.
* **Strong Password Hashing:** Master Passwords are securely hashed server-side using Argon2id (Scrypt implementation is used in this version).
* **Serverless Architecture:** Leverages Cloudflare Workers for backend logic, D1 for metadata, and R2 for encrypted data storage, offering global performance and scalability.
* **Modular Design:** Clean separation of frontend and backend code for easy maintenance and future expansion.
* **Inactivity Logout:** Automatic session termination for enhanced security.
* **Master Password Change with Re-encryption:** Secure process to update your master password, including re-encryption of all your stored data.
* **Data Export:** Ability to export your encrypted vault data for backup.

## Getting Started

---------

For detailed usage instructions for a user or admin, please refer to the dedicated documentation pages:

[Go to Documentation Site](https://passflares.com/docs.html "Passflares' Documentation Site")

## Development

---------

To set up and run locally:

1. Clone/Create Project: This will set up the file structure as described above
2. Install Dependencies:** In the project root (`DIR/Passflares`), run: `npm install`
    * **Cloudflare Local dev Setup:**
3. Install Wrangler CLI via the [Cloudflare Docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/ "Cloudflare Wrangler Install/Update Docs")
     * **Note:** Make sure you have also installed or updated `Node.js` and `npm` as per the guide above - You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install both `Node.js` and `npm`.
4. Create a local D1 Database: `npx wrangler d1 create secure-password-db --local` (required for local D1)
5. Apply D1 migrations: `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply secure-password-db --local`
6. Create the file `.dev.vars.local`
7. Generate a JWT secret, e.g. run `openssl rand -base64 512` from any terminal
8. Add this to the `.dev.vars.local` file in format `JWT_SECRET="<secret_here>"`
    * **Note:** Ensure you update the `wrangler.toml` with your details for the D1 database, and R2 bucket.
9. Run Locally: `npx wrangler dev --env local` (this will start the dev environment using the `.dev.vars.local` file for the secrets)
10. Access the frontend at the URL provided by the output (e.g., `http://127.0.0.1:8080/`).
