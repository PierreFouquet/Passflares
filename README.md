# Passflares

A modern and secure password manager which runs on the Cloudflare Stack.

## Features

* **Client-Side Encryption:** All sensitive vault data is encrypted in your browser with AES-256-GCM before being sent to Cloudflare R2. Your Master Password never leaves your device.
* **Strong Password Hashing:** Master Passwords are securely hashed server-side using Scrypt.
* **Serverless Architecture:** Cloudflare Workers for backend logic, D1 for metadata, R2 for encrypted vault blobs, and KV for rate-limit counters — global performance with no servers to run.
* **Organisations & Shared Vaults:** Create organisations, invite members, assign Member / Admin / Owner roles, and share vaults across a team.
* **Password Generator:** Built-in cryptographically-strong generator inside the entry composer.
* **Password Strength & Re-use Detection:** Dashboard surfaces weak and re-used passwords across decrypted vaults.
* **Master Password Change with Re-encryption:** Change your master password — all stored data is re-encrypted client-side.
* **Inactivity Logout:** Automatic session termination (5 minutes) for enhanced security.
* **Rate Limiting:** Failed login attempts are rate-limited via KV to prevent brute-force attacks.
* **Audit Logging:** Sensitive actions are logged server-side and available to admins.
* **Data Export:** Export your encrypted vault data for backup.
* **Theme & Density Preferences:** Dark / light / system themes, comfortable / compact density, accent colour, and shape — persisted per user.
* **Self-hosted Fonts:** No third-party font CDN calls; Inter and a Material Symbols subset are served from the worker.

## Getting Started

For detailed usage instructions for a user or admin, please refer to the dedicated documentation pages:

[Go to Documentation Site](https://passflares.com/docs/docs.html "Passflares' Documentation Site")

## Development

To set up and run locally:

1. **Clone the repo** and `cd` into it.
2. **Install dependencies:** `npm install`
3. **Install / update Wrangler** if you don't already have it — see the [Cloudflare Wrangler docs](https://developers.cloudflare.com/workers/wrangler/install-and-update/).
   * You can use [nvm](https://github.com/nvm-sh/nvm) to install `Node.js` and `npm` if needed.
4. **Create a local D1 database:** `npx wrangler d1 create secure-password-db`
5. **Apply migrations locally:** `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply secure-password-db --local`
6. **Configure local secrets:** copy `.dev.vars.example` to `.dev.vars` and fill in:
   * `JWT_SECRET` — generate with `openssl rand -base64 64`
   * `TURNSTILE_KEY` — the example file contains the Cloudflare always-passes test key, which is fine for local dev
   * `.dev.vars` is gitignored and read automatically by `wrangler dev`.
7. **Update `wrangler.toml`** with your own D1 `database_id`, R2 bucket, and KV namespace id if you're deploying.
8. **Run the dev server:** `npm run dev` (wraps `wrangler dev`).
9. The app is served at the URL printed by Wrangler (typically `http://127.0.0.1:8787/`).

## Testing

* **Unit + frontend tests (Vitest):** `npm test` (or `npm run test:watch`)
* **End-to-end tests (Playwright):** `npm run test:e2e` (or `npm run test:e2e:ui` for the UI runner)
* **Everything:** `npm run test:all`

## Deployment

The live site at [passflares.com](https://passflares.com) is built
by Cloudflare's GitHub integration, which watches the **`main`**
branch.

Other operational commands:

* **Manual worker deploy (Wrangler CLI):** `npm run deploy`
* **Apply D1 migrations in production:** `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply secure-password-db --remote`
* **Set production secrets:** `npx wrangler secret put JWT_SECRET` and `npx wrangler secret put TURNSTILE_KEY`

## Security overview

* **Master password never stored:** the password is sent over HTTPS only,
  hashed with scrypt server-side (N=32768, r=12, p=1), and only the hash is
  persisted in D1.
* **End-to-end vault encryption:** vault entries are encrypted in the
  browser with AES-256-GCM using a key derived from the master password
  (PBKDF2, 600k iterations) before the ciphertext ever reaches R2. The
  server never sees plaintext entries.
* **HSTS + tight CSP:** `Strict-Transport-Security: max-age=31536000` on
  every API response, plus a Content Security Policy that disallows inline
  scripts on the app shell.
* **Bot protection:** Cloudflare Turnstile is enforced server-side on both
  `/api/register` and `/api/login` — a missing or invalid token blocks the
  request before any DB or scrypt work happens.
* **Rate limiting:** both `/api/login` and `/api/register` lock an IP out
  after 5 failed attempts within 15 minutes (KV-backed).
* **Audit logging:** every authentication, vault-management, and
  organisation event is written to the D1 `audit_logs` table.
* **Auto sign-out:** the client signs the user out after 5 minutes of
  inactivity; the JWT itself expires after 1 hour server-side.

## Forking and self-hosting

The committed `wrangler.toml` references the upstream maintainer's
Cloudflare resources (D1 database ID, KV namespace ID, R2 bucket, and the
`passflares.com` route). Those are not secrets, but they will not work
for you — `wrangler deploy` will fail with permission errors. To stand up
your own copy:

1. Copy the template: `cp wrangler.toml.example wrangler.toml`
2. Follow the comment block at the top of that file: create your own D1
   database, KV namespace, and R2 bucket via the Wrangler CLI, then paste
   the printed IDs into `wrangler.toml`.
3. Set `JWT_SECRET` and `TURNSTILE_KEY` as Cloudflare secrets (see
   Deployment above).
4. Update the Turnstile sitekey in `public/index.html` to your own widget's
   sitekey.
5. Apply migrations: `npx wrangler d1 migrations apply secure-password-db --local` (then `--remote` once you're ready to deploy).
